A simple customizable invoice analyzer tool to help on getting control of your finances.

Since I've missed simple but customizable categorizations in current available tools (free and paid), I've created this tool to help me analyzing my invoice statement.

1. Install with `poetry install`
2. Create a `config.yml` file from [config.yml.template](src/config.yml.template)
3. Run `poetry run invoice-analyzer --config_filepath path_to_config_file`
